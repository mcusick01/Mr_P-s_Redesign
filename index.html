                <p class="para">Mr. P's Bistro specializes in low country cuisine serving the freshest, local seafood (and much more!) in Southport, North Carolina. The Phipps family is
                truly passionate about food, having perfected their product and service over three generations. The original Mr. P, Norman Phipps, started his career
                shucking oysters as a young boy at his aunt's restaurant "Faircloth Oyster Roast" in Wrightsville Beach. Mr. P had many successful restaurant ventures
                in his lifetime, but his most beloved was Mr. P's Bistro, which was started in 1995. Although Mr. P has passed, he left behind a spirit of hard work and
                dedication that has inspired his children and grandchildren, who have now begun to carry on his legacy.</p>

                  <p class="para">Stephen Phipps, Executive Chef and Mr. P's son, trained at Johnson and Wales culinary school in Charleston, South Carolina where he developed a
                passion for the low country cuisine that Mr. P's is well known for. After just a few minutes of talking with Steve, you'll know that he truly loves the
                artistry and happiness that food inspires and it shows through in every plate he serves.</p>

                <p class="para">Chris Smith, General Manager and Mr. P's son-in-law, joined the Phipps family in 1999 and after earning his restaurant management degree, he worked
                his apprenticeship under Mr. P himself. He now oversees the administrative and service aspects of Mr. P's Bistro. Chris' focus on quality service and
                hospitality make for an inviting and relaxed atmosphere that ensures everyone leaves with a smile and a memorable dining experience.</p>

                <p class="para">You'll find other family members working hard in the restaurant as well. Mr. P's daughter, Virginia, has been cooking with her brother for 30 years and
                the two make a dynamic duo. Grandson, Addison, is a well-loved server, but having literally grown up in the restaurant, he can fill in on just about any job
                that is needed from dishwasher to prep cook. Cory Smith, Chris' wife and Mr. P's youngest daughter, steps in to help the front of the house during the
                summer when we are our busiest (and when she can get away from her other love, her dance studio).</p>
